# Ray Charts

This is just a testing app for working on some custom Xamarin chart controls.

The controls themselves are in the nuget package Raydreams.Xamarin.Controls

They include a:

* Progress Meter - the ring meter with 2 modes, % complete and pie
* Progress Graph - a bar chart that overlays two bars on top of each other to show progress by period
* Multiline Graph - a typical line graph

Documentation and more controls are forthcoming.
