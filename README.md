# Ray Charts

This is a demo app for some custom Xamarin chart controls which can be found in the nuget packages download section.

They include a:

* Progress Meter - the ring meter with 2 modes, percent complete and pie
* Progress Chart - a bar chart that overlays two bars on top of each other to show progress by period
* Multiline Chart - a typical line chart

Documentation and more controls are forthcoming.
